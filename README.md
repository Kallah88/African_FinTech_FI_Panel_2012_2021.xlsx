# African_FinTech_FI_Panel_2012_2021.xlsx
The African FinTech and Financial Inclusion Panel Dataset (2012–2021) is a balanced annual panel for six Sub-Saharan African countries. It combines data from World Bank (Findex, WDI), IMF FAS, WGI, GSMA, and ITU
The dataset includes nine harmonized indicators capturing financial inclusion, FinTech adoption, and structural factors:
(1) FI_% – Financial Inclusion Index from account, credit, savings, and payment indicators;
(2) MobileMoney_% – mobile-money ownership (% of adults);
(3) DigitalTxns_%GDP – digital transactions as a share of GDP;
(4) GDP_per_capita_current_USD – income level;
(5) Internet_users_%pop – internet penetration;
(6) Urbanization_% – urban population share;
(7) Adult_literacy_% – literacy rate (% of adults 15+);
(8) Regulatory_Quality_WGI – institutional quality (−2.5 to +2.5); and
(9) Mobile_network_coverage_%pop – mobile-network coverage (% of population).

All variables were standardized and harmonized across years and countries. Missing values were interpolated using spline and logistic smoothing to yield a fully balanced panel suitable for econometric, dynamic, and threshold analyses. The dataset provides a unified empirical basis for examining how FinTech adoption, digital infrastructure, and regulatory conditions shape financial inclusion across Sub-Saharan Africa.
